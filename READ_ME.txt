This app is compiled in eclipse normally with SDK version 19.
I had an android phone that has version 2.3 to test on.

This app takes uses a search. 
To search a food item is typed in and the search icon is pressed on the right.
A user then selects the food they are interested in.
The user then swipes right to add to planned meal or left to compare the planned meal list with the item selected.
A user is able to remove items from the planned meal on click but not the comparator item.
To change comparator item, the user must swipe left at the swiping page.
