# ThinkTwice(2 Jun 2014)
Android App that allows you to compare the calorie equivalence of two items. The purpose is to make people think twice about eating high calorie dense foods by showing them how much more they can eat of the substitute. 
##Example
Add a McDonalds Big Mac to your meal, then select a healthy food item you can have instead e.g. apples.
The display will then show how many apples you could have instead, in this case it would display 1kg of apples instead of eating that bigmac.
